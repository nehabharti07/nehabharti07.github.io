<p id="sardar">He served as the secretary of the Gujarat Sabha, an organization that later evolved into the Gujarati branch of the
Indian National Congress. At the direction of Mahatma Gandhi, he launched the Kheda Satyagraha in Gujarat in
1918. It was against the British government, which imposed excessive agricultural taxation during the famine.
He advocated in 1928 for the Bardoli people, who had increased tax rates amid the financial crisis. Finally, he
could reverse the higher tax rates and return the people's confiscated lands. Known as the Iron Man of India,
Patel served as the first Deputy Prime Minister and first Minister of Home Affairs of India. He earned the title
"Sardar" for his work in Bardoli Satyagraha on behalf of his nation. He retired from his career and chose to
contribute to the nation's liberation even though he was a well-known lawyer.</p>

<li><b>Mahtma Gandhi(1869-1948)</b></li><br>

<p id="gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi is known as the “Father of the Nation .” He was the leader of the Indian independence
movement. He carried out a nationwide campaign after his return to India in 1915, where he learned about
the issues Indians were facing. Therefore, he organised and led three significant movements: the
Ahmedabad mill strike in 1918, the Kheda Satyagraha in 1918, and the Champaran Satyagraha in 1917.
He founded the Satyagraha Sabha in 1919 in opposition to the Rowlatt Act, which he called the "Black
Act." He began the Non-Cooperation movement in 1920 to win Purna Swaraj and self-rule. In 1930, he
organised the Salt Satyagraha, popularly known as the Dandi March, to protest against the salt law. He
started the Quit India Movement in 1942 at the All India Congress Committee meeting in Mumbai after
the defeat of the Cripps Mission.</p>

<li>Jawhar lal Nehru(1889-1964)</b></li><br>

<p id="nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru was a close associate of Gandhi and the first Prime Minister of independent India. He
played a crucial role in shaping India's political landscape and was instrumental in drafting the Indian
Constitution. Nehru's leadership and vision guided the country in its early years of independence. He
established India's economic policy in 1938 by forming the National Planning Commission. Gandhi
named him his political heir in<strong> 1942. On August 15, 1947,</stong> he became India's first prime minister.</p>

<li><b>Bhagat Singh(1907-1931)</b></li><br>
<img src="C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\bhagat.jpeg"><br>
<p id="nehru">Bhagat Singh believed in a political philosophy called revolutionary socialism. In 1926, he founded the
Naujawan Bharat Sabha, which aimed to revolt against the British by gathering the peasants and the
workers (especially the young ones). He served as the secretary of the Sabha. He joined the Hindustan
Republican Association and became an active member. Later on, he became the leader of that association.
After the death of his leader, Lala Lajpat Rai, due to severe lathi charges in the protest against the Simon
Commission, Bhagat Singh and other revolutionaries decided to kill the police officer responsible for it.
But because of the mistaken identity, he shot another police officer named John Poyantz Saunders. To
oppose the Defence of India Act of 1915, on April 8, 1929, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, he threw two
bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly. He threw leaflets while chanting the slogan ‘Inquilab
Zindabad,’ which means long live the resolution. Later, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were arrested
and hanged to death for their revolutionary activities.</p>

<p id="azad">Chandra Shekhar Sitaram Tiwari popularly known as the Chandrashekhar Azad was a young revolutionary
freedom fighter. Chandra Shekhar Azad was born on July 23, 1906, in Bhabhra village of Alirajpur. When
Mahatma Gandhi suspended the non-cooperation movement in 1922, Azad was disappointed and then he
met with Ram Prasad Bismil who founded the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA). He participated
in multiple activities and incidents that can be counted as the baby steps towards the big battle. Leading to
his revolutionary activities he was betrayed by the police and was shot in a battle at Allahabad’s Alfred
Park (now Azad Park) where he was shot after he wounded two officers with his bullets.</p>
